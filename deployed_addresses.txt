Contract verification at Etherscan.io

1 - Flatten Contracts
Error for cross reference: in Store.sol I've commented out
the import "./Marketplace.sol", because in Marketplace.sol 
already have a reference to Store contract (import "./Store.sol")

2 - Paste de full flatten contract an Remix IDE
Compile, check for errors and deploy contract.

3 - Deploy contract
I've deployed the contract again in the Rinkeby Network, the tx is
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0x686bc0152b1e5de7190ba492d204c68e0342cb3c1ce7ea82e650c28017a04bfa
The contract address is 0x0b1222e2df4d3afa42e6409530180ad00445f9e8

4 - Verify & Publish Contract Source Code
From the Verify and Publish link:
  Compiler Type: Solidity (Single file)
  Compiler Version: v.0.5.1 (same at Remix IDE)
  Optimization: true (same at Remix IDE)

Paste Source Code and cross fingers...
If everything goes well you will see a success message in the generated source code, 
ABI and ByteCode generated for your contract.
Now your contract will display a green verified check in the Contract tab at Etherscan!

Congrats!
